#### Active learning in the Rare Classes scenario
In these experiments, we compare the performance of SMI functions with baselines in a rare classes scenario.
More details can be found in [SIMILAR: Submodular Information Measures Based Active Learning In Realistic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00717).

We observe that the SMI functions (specifically LOGDETMI, FLQMI) outperform other baselines by more than 10% on the rare classes.
