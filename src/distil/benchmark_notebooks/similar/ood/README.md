#### Active learning in the Out-of-distribution (OOD) data scenario
In these experiments, we compare the performance of SCMI functions with baselines and SMI functions in the OOD data scenario.
More details can be found in [SIMILAR: Submodular Information Measures Based Active Learning In Realistic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00717).

We see that, i) the SCMI functions consistently outperform the baselines by 5% âˆ’ 10%, ii) SCMI functions outperform the corresponding SMI functions for later rounds, and (iii) SCMI functions have the least variance compared to the rest, showing that they are more robust in performance.
