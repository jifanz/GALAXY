#### Active learning in the Redundancy scenario
In these experiments, we compare the performance of SCG functions with baselines in a redundancy scenario.
More details can be found in [SIMILAR: Submodular Information Measures Based Active Learning In Realistic Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00717).

We observe that the CG functions (LOGDETCG, FLCG) pick more unique points and outperform existing algorithms.
