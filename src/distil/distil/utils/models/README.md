### DISTIL has incorporated popular model architectures like DenseNet, ResNet, MobileNet, VGG etc

### To use custom model architecture, modify the model architecture in the following way:

  - The forward method should have two more variables:

    - A boolean variable ‘last’ which -

      - If true:  returns the model output and the output of the second last layer
      
      - If false: Returns the model output. 
    
    - A boolean variable ‘freeze’ which -
      
       - If true: disables the tracking of any calculations required to later calculate a gradient i.e skips gradient calculation over the weights
      
       - If false: otherwise

  - get_embedding_dim() method which returns the number of hidden units in the last layer.
